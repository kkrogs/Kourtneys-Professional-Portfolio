# Kourtneys-Professional-Portfolio

The title of this Project is: Kourtneys Professional Portfolio. The reason why this project is so important is becasue it will showcase all of my work to prospective employers.

HOW IT WORKS:
If you click on the 'about', 'work' or 'contactme' buttons at the top of the page, you are brought to the corresponding section within the page. This makes for easier page accessiblility to a new person navigating the website.

In the ABOUT ME section, you are greeted with an introductory paragraph about my work experience and how it will be useful to prospective employers.

In the WORK section, you will see a short paragraph on my first project so far, the 'code refractor'. When you click on the image, you are then brought to the coding of the deplolyed application in github as well as a placeholder image for when I add my next project.

In the coding section, you will also find descriptions of what each element does on the page.
When adjusting the page size, you will also find that the images move around and fit according to each mobile phone or tablet size.

Thank you for reading and enjoy my portfolio page!
